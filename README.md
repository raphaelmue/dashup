# dashup
The dashup platform provides a quick overview of multiple microservices hosted on 
external servers of different providers. Therefore users no longer have to access 
microservices on separated ways and can gain quick insights into real time data of 
different microservices on one central platform. Furthermore, dashup provides a 
compressed pool of functionalities for each microservice. Dashup is therefore 
considered to be a productivity tool, running as a web-application on modern 
browsers. Each microservice will be displayed on the central dashboard by its 
individual panel containing different components for data visualization. Whereas 
users are provided with a collection of default microservices at the beginning, 
they can later enhance their dashboard with further microservices from the dashup 
store. In addition, there should be the possibility to integrate own microservices 
as customly defined panels to keep track of all of one's own applications.
