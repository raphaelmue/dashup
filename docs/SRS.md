Software Requirements Specification

# 1. Introduction


\[The introduction of the **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)** should provide an overview of the entire **SRS**. It should include the purpose, scope, definitions, acronyms, abbreviations, references, and overview of the **SRS**.\]

\[Note: The Software Requirements Specification (**SRS**) captures the complete software requirements for the system, or a portion of the system.  Following is a typical **SRS** outline for a project using only traditional natural-language style requirements – with **no use-case modeling.** It captures all requirements in a single document,  with  applicable sections inserted from the  Supplementary Specifications (which would no longer be needed).  For a template of an **SRS** using use-case modeling, which consists of a package containing Use-Cases of the use-case model and applicable Supplementary Specifications and other supporting information, see rup\_**SRS**\-uc.dot.\]

\[Many different arrangements of an **SRS** are possible.  Refer to \[IEEE830-1998\] for further elaboration of these explanations, as well as other options for **SRS** organization.\]

##1.1 Purpose


This Software Requirements Specification was created to collect and organize the requirements for the dashup platform.
It describes the expected functional and nonfunctional functionality of the platform. This is necessary in order to 
achieve a common understanding between the client and the software supplier.
Furthermore it is needed to evaluate the results of the project.

##1.2 Scope

The dashup platform should provide a quick overview on multiple microservices without accessing them all separably. 
It should be a productivity tool which is usable in webbrowser. There will be a collection of default microservices 
which are developed and hosted by the project team. Furthermore there should be the possibility to integrate own microservices 
to keep track of all own applications.     

##1.3 Definitions, Acronyms and Abbreviations


\[This subsection should provide the definitions of all terms, acronyms, and abbreviations required to properly interpret the **SRS**.  This information may be provided by reference to the project Glossary.\]

##1.4 References


\[This subsection should provide a complete list of all documents referenced elsewhere in the **SRS**.  Each document should be identified by title, report number (if applicable), date, and publishing organization.  Specify the sources from which the references can be obtained. This information may be provided by reference to an appendix or to another document.\]

##1.5 Overview


\[This subsection should describe what the rest of the **SRS** contains and explain how the document is organized.\]

#2 Overall Description


\[This section of the **SRS** should describe the general factors that affect the product and its requirements.  This section does not state specific requirements.  Instead, it provides a background for those requirements, which are defined in detail in Section 3, and makes them easier to understand. Include such items as:

•               product perspective

•               product functions

•             user characteristics

•               constraints

•               assumptions and dependencies

•               requirements subsets\]

#3 Specific Requirements

\[This section of the **SRS** should contain all the software requirements to a level of detail sufficient to enable designers to design a system to satisfy those requirements, and testers to test that the system satisfies those requirements.   When using use-case modeling, these requirements are captured in the Use-Cases and the applicable supplementary specifications.  If use-case modeling is not used, the outline for supplementary specifications may be inserted directly into this section, as shown below.\]

##3.1 Functionality


\[This section describes the functional requirements of the system for those requirements which are expressed in the natural language style. For many applications, this may constitute the bulk of the **SRS** Package and thought should be given to the organization of this section. This section is typically organized by feature, but alternative organization methods may also be appropriate, for example, organization by user or organization by subsystem.  Functional requirements may include feature sets, capabilities, and security.

Where application development tools, such as requirements tools, modeling tools, etc., are employed to capture the functionality, this section document will refer to the availability of that data, indicating the location and name of the tool that is used to capture the data.\]

### 3.1.1 <Functional Requirement One>

\[The requirement description.\]

##3.2 Usability

\[This section should include all of those requirements that affect usability. For example,

•               specify the required training time for a normal users and a power user to become productive at particular operations

•               specify measurable task times for typical tasks or base the new system’s usability requirements on other systems that the users know and like

•               specify requirement to conform to common usability standards, such as IBM’s CUA standards Microsoft’s GUI standards\]

### 3.2.1 <Usability Requirement One>

\[The requirement description goes here.\]

##3.3 Reliability


\[Requirements for reliability of the system should be specified here. Some suggestions follow:

•               Availability—specify the percentage of time available ( xx.xx%), hours of use, maintenance access, degraded mode operations, etc.

•               Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) — this is usually specified in hours, but it could also be specified in terms of days, months or years.

•               Mean Time To Repair (MTTR)—how long is the system allowed to be out of operation after it has failed?

•               Accuracy—specify precision (resolution) and accuracy (by some known standard) that is required in the system’s output.

•               Maximum Bugs or Defect Rate—usually expressed in terms of bugs per thousand of lines of code (bugs/KLOC) or bugs per function-point( bugs/function-point).

•               Bugs or Defect Rate—categorized in terms of minor, significant, and critical bugs: the requirement(s) must define what is meant by a “critical” bug; for example, complete loss of data or a complete inability to use certain parts of the system’s functionality.\]

### 3.3.1 <Reliability Requirement One>

\[The requirement description.\]

## 3.4 Performance

### 3.4.1 Response Time

The response time should be as low as possible. The reload of the page may not take longer than 8 seconds and in average a response time of 5 seconds is acceptable. Therfore the backend should keep up graphic elements like the panels to avoid too large computing effort, if there is a high number of panels mandated on the dashborad of a user.

### 3.4.2 Throughput
The information displayed on the different panels showed in the dashboard should be reloaded every 10ms. Because of the provision of these data by foreign APIs and servers the fetchung process could take longer. To prevent such a scenario corresponding connventions and rules will be introduced.

### 3.4.2 Capacity
The dashboard is to be made for a large number of users. An increase of new members shouldn't slow down the system in the same way.

### 3.4.2 Degradation modes
/tbd

### 3.4.2 Resource utilization
The server used provides the follwing resources for the dashboard: . On the frontend-side the application has to be as lightweight as possible to make the use also comfortable for users with lower system properties.

## 3.5 Supportability


\[This section indicates any requirements that will enhance the supportability or maintainability of the system being built, including coding standards, naming conventions, class libraries, maintenance access, maintenance utilities.\]

### 3.5.1 <Supportability Requirement One>

\[The requirement description goes here.\]

##3.6 Design Constraints


\[This section should indicate any design constraints on the system being built. Design constraints represent design decisions that have been mandated and must be adhered to.  Examples include software languages, software process requirements, prescribed use of developmental tools, architectural and design constraints, purchased components, class libraries, etc.\]

### 3.6.1 <Design Constraint One>

\[The requirement description goes here.\]

##3.7 On-line User Documentation and Help System Requirements


\[Describes the requirements, if any, for on-line user documentation, help systems, help about notices, etc.\]

3.8 Purchased Components
------------------------

\[This section describes any purchased components to be used with the system, any applicable licensing or usage restrictions, and any associated compatibility and interoperability or interface standards.\]

3.9 Interfaces
--------------

### 3.9.1 User Interfaces

* **Login screen** that provides input fields to login.
* **Registration screen** where he user can set up an new account.
* **Main dashboard** on which the user can see all his panels and the information provided by the microservices.
* **Profile management screen** where a user can edit and update her/his personal information.
* **Marketplace** where default and custom microservices can be found and added to own dashboard.
* **Panel editor** on which developers can create their own panels to display information from their own microservices. 

### 3.9.2 Hardware Interfaces

N/A

### 3.9.3 Software Interfaces

The dashup application runs in a webbroser. We will try to make it work in many different webbrowsers as possible.

### 3.9.4 Communications Interfaces

The webapplication should communicate with the java backend by a secured HTTPS connection on Port 443. If there should 
be a unencrypted connection via HTTP is still to be determined. The Connection should be asynchronous to avoid a reload 
of the webapplication.   

##3.10 Licensing Requirements


tbd

##3.11 Legal, Copyright, and Other Notices

The "dashup" team will not take any responsibility for lost data and other damages done to your microservice or other programs. 
The "dashup" logo may only be used for the official "dashup" application.

##3.12 Applicable Standards

The code of "dashup" shuold follow some basic rules of clean code such as:
* Intuitive names of variables and methods.
* Comments to improve understanding and readability of the code.
* Design patterns integration.
* No hard-coded strings.
* No premature optimization.

If necessary there can be exceptions to this rules, but they have to be well considered and discussed.
