# 3. Special Requirements
In order to add panels to one's own dashboard through the marketplace 
or to browse through the marketplace, a persistent internet connection is needed, 
to fetch data from the database.

# 4. Preconditions

## 4.1 Sufficient amount of microservices
To take use of the marketplace, a default amount of panels provided by the 
community should be available. If there are only the built-in dashup panels for certain microservices
available, the actual sense of a true _marketplace_ would get lost.

## 4.2 Sufficient amount of ratings
In order to get a good overview over the panel's quality, there should be a certain quantity of
ratings provided by the community in order to fill the rating menu of a panel with a 
decent amount of data.

## 4.3 Metadata provided for each microservice
To properly display information about a panel for a microservice, metadata such as version, publisher, etc. must be provided.
Furthermore the publisher must have given a detailed description about the panel to 
display it on the main menu of a panel in the marketplace.

## 4.4 Logged in to dashup
In order to use the marketplace, the user must be logged in to dashup.

# 5. Postconditions
After the use of the marketplace, the database should by synchronized according the actions 
that the user performed. 

# 6. Extension Points
