# 1. Use-Case Name - Brief Description

In the use case _panel_, the process of adding as well as removing a panel to dashup is described.
Another topic is the general way of using such a panel, as each panel should align with specific guidelines and 
conventions, that are proposed to a panel in dashup. This UCS will not cover how a panel should be implemented or structured,
as this is left open to the individual needs and wishes of a user for the use case _custom_panel_.
