# Coding conventions of dashup

## Git

- Commit only relevant files
- Commit message has to contain branch name, e.g. "master: [...]"
- Do not commit on master branch (except for documentation changes or similar)
- Reviews: 
    - When a feature is implemented, open a pull request and add all other contributors as reviewers
    - Take reviews serious!
    - Do not merge your issue or feature branch if there is no pull request

## Maven

- Add only dependencies if they are necessary
- The same applies to plugins

## Code in general

- Run formatter before committing
- Do not commit errors
- Do not commit warnings
- No codacy issues

## Consequences

Each violation of the conventions leads to 1 beer. At the end of the project, all contributors meet and drink that beer until they are "sternhagelvoll".
